Personal project that is mostly on hold because of scope.

Working on other things will smaller scope, will probably rebuild this from scratch when I want to get back on it.

Main concept is a mixed farming/shop management sim, with small amounts of automation. You would play as a witch moving to a small town which isn't fond of magic, gaining trust of the townfolk over time.
